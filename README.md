#Agile vs DevOps
In Agile application development is done in sprints instead of waterfall model, with smaller teams
DevOps approach ennsure that code and infrastructure are always in a deployable state
#Define CI,Contineous Delivery and Contineous Deployment
Contineous Integration ensure that every check-in is build automatically and notify dev team incase build fails so application code is in deployable state
Contineous Delivery required manual steps before deploying to production environment or any other stage
Contineous Deployment every succesfull build is deployed to production environment directly it doesn,t involve manual approval
